Whats left?

comparison to centered FD

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

03/08/2017

+ added version control
+ rewrote boundary conditions(specify each boundary individually)
%%+ added parfor
+ rewrote matrix construction

- adding adaptive time stepping
-- 3rd order with fixed leading coefficient(FLC)
-- 4th order without FLC

- trying to break the code with high Re
-- fixing bug in y-direction (curl-curl)

03/09/2017

+ use sparse matrix construction instead of parfor
++ formLHSU1
++ formLHSU1
++ formLHSP
+ setup individual boundary conditions
- matlab spmd LU( performance is not clear..)

03/14/2017

++ combine formLHSU1 and formLHSV1
++ fix the bugs for boundary condition 2,3
++ move this to git..
